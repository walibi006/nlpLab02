The project consists of 4 main parts:
    - Getting a dataset and understanding how it's structured
    - Implementing two Naive Bayes classifiers, (one by hand and one using scikit-learn)
    - Comparing the two classifiers
    - Implementing stemming or lemmatization and comparing the results


Our implementiation consists of a single file, `nlpLab02.py`, which contains all the code for the project.
it uses the following libraries:
    - `datasets` for the dataset
    - `scikit-learn` for the Naive Bayes classifier
    - `nltk` for the lemmatization
